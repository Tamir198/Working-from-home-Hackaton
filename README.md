Easy zoom:

This app was made during the [MTA Hack 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mtahack/).

The idea and the execution earned us the 1st prize of the Hackathon!

The theme of the event was 'Working From Home' and was focused on finding creative solutions to challenges that arise when working from home. Our team decided to focus the efforts on finding solutions to those who don't usually receive the proper attention: The Educational staff.

We pinpointed a problem with the built-in Zoom interface, being less intuitive and comfortable for non-tech-oriented people. The idea was to focus on the most commonly used, important, and immediate functions that multi-participant video chats provide, such as Muting participants, Checking attendance, Creating a chat room, Sharing a link to Whatsapp. further options can be added upon demand and availability within the Zoom API.

The UI is designed to be as simple as possible. Clean, Clear, Large buttons with text information. The UI is currently in Hebrew to provide a solution for Hebrew-speaking teachers.
